# Employment History

### Windows Systems Administrator -> Senior IT Engineer | Jagex 2014 -current

In 2004 a friend I had ironically met through online games brought an opportunity to me. It was a Systems Administrator role. After investigating the games they made and hearing about their plans and day to day challenges from that friend it seemed like an obvious next step.

It was immediately different because I was part of a team rather than an individual engineer responsible and accountable for everything.

It started with projects quite familiar to me but at a very different scale and complexity. They had built an "air gapped" development network and realised it wasn't fit for purpose in 2014 so early projects were about enabling developers to develop. There had never been a true "air gap", holes had been poked to allow people to work so we initially set out to replace holes with fit for purpose services.

The first major project I led was the replacement of a Linux based file server with a larger, more resilient Windows based solution. As well as more space it offered better client compatibility and more granular access control. In addition to the technical build this required me to develop processes and standards around data which Jagex had never really considered at that time. This allowed my team to divide and conquer. Finding "Data Owners" for shares, working through a process with them to identify access needs and transposing them into AD managed ACLs which would be extensible and auditable before migrating the data. These processes and standards formed the basis for many refactors, migrations and new services both in my team, the wider IT team and the business as a whole.

Providing a service to our users rather than just a piece of hardware or software technology is how consider everything I've been involved in delivering while at Jagex, which includes: 
- ADFS to Azure AD migration and service extension.
- On Premise to Exchange Hybrid migration.
- Hipchat to Slack migration - Lead
- OS Migrations ( Windows 7 to 10, Server 2008 > 2012 > 2016 > 2019 )
- SCCM Rebuild - Lead
- SCOM monitoring Implementation
- VMware ESXi Expansion - Lead
- VMware VCenter replacement. Windows > Appliance - Lead
- SAN Migration VMware & SQL
- Zoom Implementation
- Lastpass Implementation - Lead
- EDR Implementation -Lead
- Centralised Logging ( Managed SoC ) Implementation - Lead
- CIS Hardening of OSes and network Equipment
- Privileged Access Management - Lead
- Replacement of Office Network including Datacenter
- Disaster Recovery Datacenter
- Backup System Replacement - Lead ( Ongoing )

I believe it's thanks to knowledge of the technologies and my approach to organisation and people that I quickly became a trusted pair of hands to 4 IT managers in my time at Jagex. As a result of that I've been involved in the majority of disasters and incidents that have occurred. My duties during these have included technical lead, investigation / forensics. As a result I've also been involved in liaison between internal and external incident response teams, internal and external legal teams as well as law enforcement agencies. 

Disasters and Incidents include:
- Exchange Recovery
- Data Breaches
- Insider threat investigations
- Vulnerability Disclosures

The culture at Jagex has allowed me to get involved in projects which interested me and I wanted to develop in. It was no surprise that security would be one of those. I've always been passionate about not just delivering something but in its whole life cycle, the risks it presents, how they can be mitigated, monitored and alerted on. Actually being asked to focus on that the last few years has allowed me to learn and put that learning straight into practice. What was more of a surprise to me was to find I was interested in how work gets done. Jagex has undergone an "agile transformation" which has in some areas been a paper exercise or source of frustration but it has given me the opportunity to work with some really good agile delivery coaches and project managers. The skills I've learned from them have helped me contribute meaningfully to the evolution of working practices in the IT department and I'm excited about using and growing them. 

### IT Technician | Grosvenor Grammar School 2004 - 2014

When I saw the advert for the IT technician role at the school I had attended I was immediately intrigued. During my time there as a pupil they had Apple Macintosh and Windows PC networks installed and even then I realised it had not been done well. The opportunity to fix that and at the same time have a stable salaried job was too good to pass up.

Things had not stood still at the school in the intervening years but the quality of work done by companies contracted by the Belfast Education and Library board had not improved.  I immediately set about joining the disparate networks across the campus together and merging their 5 Active Directory domains and the services they supported together. Within three years Windows NT4 was gone, authentication, printing and storage were accessible universally across departments with appropriate access control and auditing.

The internet was also universally available across all connected devices for the first time via Linux based internet access gateway I built as a proof of concept. It provided user ID based web filtering, logging and load balancing over 2 ADSL lines. As expected it was recognised as a hugely important educational and administrative tool which allowed me to make the case for procuring dedicated hardware to run Smoothwall School Guardian, the commercial product I had based my Open Source solution on.

By the time I left I had expanded the estate in various phases to include some ~700 client workstations and ~ 20 servers. The servers by then were a mix of Windows 2008R2 and Linux presenting 20TB of storage either provisioned directly or via iSCSI to Virtual machines running on Microsoft Hyper-V.

I evolved professionally during this time from a Technician role to effectively the network manager, working directly with the Headmaster on the major initiatives including the design and eventual relocation to a new school building. I also became involved with supplier selection and procurement at the school board level by this time as Grosvenor was one of the largest Grammar schools in the BELB and very influential at the level.

During the last few years the school saw the need to expand the technical support available to teaching staff. While no "manager" role was possible for support staff in the BELB structure at that time I defined the day to day work for 4 technicians eventually leaving the estate in the safe hands of one of them.

### Agency work 2004

Through 2004 I enrolled with the Blueprint and Select agencies in Belfast and worked for short periods of time in local universities, businesses and larger IT service companies such as UTV Internet and Northgate Information Systems. Every few weeks a new place, exposing me to new hardware, software and people. 

### Self Employed | Elite Systems 1998 - 2004
In secondary school I began repairing computers and setting up internet and e-mail for family members, then their friends and beyond by word of mouth. Realising people were happy to pay for  someone capable and approachable with those skills, I expanded this over time to looking after the systems of local businesses such as video producers, local solicitors and accountancy practices. Contracts included everything from basic maintenance and troubleshooting, through data recovery to modernisation of offices replacing standalone PCs or in at least one case type writers with PCs networked to local servers offering e-mail and document management.
